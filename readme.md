# 🎮 Yet Another Tic-Tac-Toe

A **Tic-Tac-Toe** game built with **Preact**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, and **Plain CSS**. This project showcases advanced **React/Preact** concepts like `Context`, `useImperativeHandle`, and includes **AI-powered moves**. It also features **machine learning** using **TensorFlow.js** for training and prediction, along with **Howler.js** for immersive audio effects.

## 🤖 AI & Machine Learning

The game AI is powered by a combination of:

- **Minimax Algorithm** – Traditional decision-making for optimal moves.
- **TensorFlow.js** – **Trains and predicts moves** based on past gameplay.

### 🧠 **How TensorFlow.js Works in This Project**

- AI **learns from previous games** and adapts.
- **Trains on winning strategies** and improves predictions.
- **Predicts best moves** based on trained model & Minimax.
